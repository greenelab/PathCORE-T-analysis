Recently, we showed that during CF lung persistence PA mutators converge to a virulence-attenuated phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that besides virulence-associated traits (VATs) the adaptation process of PA predominantly comprises metabolic pathways. In end-stage mutator strains, transcripts of genes encoding VATs, chemotaxis, degradation of aromatic compounds and several two-component regulatory systems were decreased. In contrast, several transcripts of genes or proteins involved in metabolism of fatty acids, nucleotides, amino acids and the generation of energy were increased. Of particular interest is the increased expression level of genes involved in (i) the anaerobic arginine-deiminase pathway, (ii) the anaerobic respiration such as nitrate-uptake protein OprF, redox-active azurin and cytchrome c551 peroxidase, (iii) the micro-aerobic respiration such as high oxygen-affinity cytochrome oxidase cbb3 (iv) the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), glyoxylate shunt and anaplerotic carboxylation reactions to oxaloacetate. Strikingly, an increased transcription of the anaerobic regulator gene anr correlates with the up-regulation of ANR-dependent genes. In conclusion, these changes in transcriptome and proteome indicate an adaptive shift towards constitutive expression of genes of metabolic pathways obviously required for growth under micro-aerobic and nutritional conditions of suppurative CF lung tissue. Finally, these results provide us with new targets for antimicrobial agents and biomarkers reflecting adaptation of PA towards progressive CF lung disease. Experiment Overall Design: P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from different time points of chronic cystic fibrosis lung disease were cultered in vitro, harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We compared the transcriptome (triplicate microarrays) of early non-mutator P. aeruginosa isolates with late mutator isolates with high mutation frequency probably the driving force of an efficient adaptation to changing environements to conclude from differences in gene expression to the requirements of CF lung environment.

Xanthi)	Leaf	in vivo		RNA	30	24 hours	24 h; Nicotiana tabacum cultivars Xanthi nc [NN]	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 24 hour growth of Pa in resistant cultivar tobacco plant leaves, replicate 1	Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that does not often naturally infect alternate hosts such as plants, the plant-P. aeruginosa model has become a widely recognized system for identifying new virulence determinants and studying pathogenesis of this organism. Here we examine how both host factors and P. aeruginosa PAO1 gene expression are affected in planta after infiltration into incompatible and compatible cultivars of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) Nicotiana tabacum has a resistance gene (N) against tobacco mosaic virus; and although resistance to PAO1 infection correlated to the presence of a dominant N-gene, our data suggests that it is not a factor in resistance against Pseudomonas. We did observe that the resistant tobacco cultivar had higher basal levels of salicylic acid, and a stronger salicylic acid response upon infiltration of PAO1. Salicylic acid acts as a signal to activate defense responses in plants, limiting the spread of the pathogen and preventng access to nutrients. It has also been shown to have direct virulence modulating effects on P. aeruginosa. We also examined host effects on the pathogen by analyzing global gene expression profiles of bacteria removed from the intracellular fluid of the two plant hosts. We discovered that the availability of micronutrients, particularly sulfate and Pi, are important factors in in planta pathogenesis, and that the amounts of these nutrients made available to the bacteria may in turn have an effect on virulence gene expression. Indeed, there are several reports suggesting that P. aeruginosa virulence is influenced in mammalian hosts by the availability of iron and by levels of O2. Experiment Overall Design: Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells were removed from leaf tissue 24 hours post-infiltration and RNA was directly extracted from these cells. Comparisons are between cells removed from a susceptible cultivar of Nicotiana tabacum (cv. Samsun) and a resistant cultivar (cv. Xanthi). Three biological replicates per cultivar were analyzed.

Rep1	Biofilm formation and type III secretion have been shown to be reciprocally regulated in P. aeruginosa, and it has been suggested that factors related to acute infection may be incompatible; with biofilm formation. We investigated how growth conditions influence the production of virulence factors by studying the inter-relationships between colonies, biofilms and planktonic cells. We found that biofilms in our growth conditions express the type III secretion and these lifestyles are therefore not mutually exclusive in P. aeruginosa. Experiment Overall Design: Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells grown in five different conditions were analysed with three biological replicates for each sample. The five different conditions were planktonic cells in exponential phase, planktonic cells in stationary phase, colonies on agar plates incubated for 15 or 40 hours and biofilms in a continuous flow system after three days of growth.

The effects of sub-inhibitory colistin on gene expression in P. aeruginosa were investigated by transcriptome microarray and functional analysis. Analysis revealed an alteration in the expression of 60 genes in total from a variety of pathways. Genes associated with bacterial chronic colonisation and virulence such as response to osmotic stress, motility, and biofilm formation, as well as those associated with LPS modification and quorum sensing are the most highly represented. Most striking among these is the upregulation of the PQS biosynthesis operon including pqsH, pqsE, and the anthranilate biosynthetic genes phnAB. Early activation of this central component of the QS-network may represent a switch to a more robust population, with increased fitness in the competitive environment of the CF-lung. Experiment Overall Design: Three independent cultures of the P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 were exposed to 0.15 µg colistin ml–1. The untreated and treated samples were grown from OD600 0.05 to 0.8 and subsequently total RNA was extracted using the Ambion RiboPureTm- Bacteria kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

In this study, we report that the hormone norepinephrine increases P. aeruginosa PA14 growth, virulence factor production, invasion of HCT-8 epithelial cells, and swimming motility in a concentration-dependent manner. Transcriptome analysis of P. aeruginosa exposed to 500 µM, but not 50 µM, norepinephrine for 7 h showed that genes involved in the regulation of the virulence determinants pyocyanin, elastase, and Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone) were up-regulated. The production of rhamnolipids, which are also important in P. aeruginosa infections, was significantly decreased on semi-solid surfaces, but not in planktonic cultures, upon exposure to norepinephrine. Swarming motility, a phenotype that is directly influenced by rhamnolipids, was also decreased upon 500 µM norepinephrine exposure. The increase in the transcriptional activation of lasR, but not that of rhlR, suggest that the effects of norepinephrine are mediated primarily through the las quorum sensing pathway. Together, our data strongly suggests that norepinephrine can play an important role in gut-derived infections by increasing the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa PA14. For growth rate measurements, a single colony of PA14 was grown overnight in Luria Bertini (LB) broth, and re-inoculated in serum-RPMI medium in the presence of 50 µM and 500 µM NE to an initial turbidity of ~ 0.05 at 600 nm. The turbidity of the cultures at 600 nm was monitored every hour and growth rate of the exponentially growing cultures was calculated. Growth curves were obtained in triplicate using three independent cultures, and the statistical significance of specific growth rate was determined using the unpaired Student’s t-test. Total RNA isolation and microarray analysis PA14 was grown overnight in LB to turbidity at 600 nm of ~5.0 and diluted in 100 mL of serum-RPMI medium to an initial turbidity at 600 nm of 0.05. Different concentrations of NE (50 µM or 500 µM) were added and the cultures grown for 7 hours till late exponential phase (turbidity at 600 nm of ~0.5, 1.1 and 1.5 with 0 µM, 50 µM and 500 µM NE, respectively). Cell pellets were prepared and RNA was isolated as described previously (Ren et al. 2004a). The P. aeruginosa Genome Array (Affymetrix, P/N 510596) containing 5,500 of the 5,570 open reading frames of P. aeruginosa PA01, was used to analyze changes in the PA14 transcriptome. cDNA synthesis, fragmentation and hybridizations were as described previously (Gonzalez Barrios et al. 2006). Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 50°C, and the total cell intensity was scaled to an average value of 500. The probe array images were inspected for any image artifact. Background values, noise values and scaling factors of all the arrays were examined and were comparable. The intensities of polyadenosine RNA control were used to monitor the labelling process. For each binary microarray comparison of differential genes expression, if the gene with the larger transcription rate did not have a consistent transcription rate based on the 13 probe pairs (P-value less than 0.05), these genes were discarded. A gene was considered differentially expressed when the P-value for comparing two chips was lower than 0.05 (to assure that the change in gene expression was statistically significant and that false positives arise less than 5%), and the expression ratio (between cells treated with NE and control) was greater than 4.0 for the 50 µM NE array and 2.0 for 500 µM NE array (based on the standard deviation of fold-change values) (Ren et al. 2004b). Gene functions and locus tag numbers were obtained from the Pseudomonas Genome Database (http://www.pseudomonas.com/download.jsp).

This screen identified the PA3885 mutant, which had 147-fold more biofilm than the wild-type strain. Loss of PA3885 decreased swimming, abolished swarming, and increased attachment, although this did not affect production of rhamnolipids. The PA3885 mutant also had a wrinkly colony phenotype, formed pronounced pellicles, had substantially more aggregation, and had 28-fold more exopolysaccharide production. Expression of PA3885 in trans reduced biofilm formation and abolished aggregation. Whole transcriptome analysis showed that loss of PA3885 activated expression of the pel locus, an operon that encodes for the synthesis of extracellular matrix polysaccharide. Genetic screening identified that loss of PelABDEG and the PA1120 protein (which contains a GGDEF-motif) suppressed the phenotypes of the PA3885 mutant, suggesting that the function of the PA3885 protein is to regulate 3,5-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) concentrations as a phosphatase since c-di-GMP enhances biofilm formation by activating PelD, and c-di-GMP inhibits swarming. Loss of PA3885 protein increased cellular c-di-GMP concentrations; hence, PA3885 protein is a negative regulator of c-di-GMP production. Purified PA3885 protein has phosphatase activity against phosphotyrosine peptides and is translocated to the periplasm. Las-mediated quorum sensing positively regulates expression of the PA3885 gene. These results show that the PA3885 protein responds to AHL signals and likely dephosphorylates PA1120, which leads to reduced c-di-GMP production. This inhibits matrix exopolysaccharide formation, which leads to reduced biofilm formation; hence, we provide a mechanism for quorum sensing control of biofilm formation through the pel locus and suggest PA3885 should be named TpbA for tyrosine phosphatase related to biofilm formation and PA1120 should be TpbB.

CSS senses signals from outside the cell and transmits them into the cytoplasm. It consists of a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor, a cytoplasmic membrane-localized sigma factor regulator (or anti-sigma factor), and an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor. Upon perception of the extracellular signal by the receptor the ECF sigma factor is activated and promotes the transcription of a specific set of gene(s). Although most P. aeruginosa ECF sigma factors are involved in the regulation of iron uptake, we have identified a novel ECF sigma factor (PA0675) involved in the regulation of virulence. By microarray analysis of cells overexpressing PA0675 from the pMUM3 plasmid we have identified the genes regulated by this sigma factor. Two different samples are analyzed namely P. aeruginosa (pMMB67EH) (control/reference sample) and P. aeruginosa (pMUM3) (overexpressing the PA0675 ECF sigma factor). Two different replicates per sample are included.

As a ubiquitous environmental organism that is occasionally part of the human flora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa could pose a health hazard for the immuno-compromised astronauts. In order to gain insights in the behavior of P. aeruginosa in spaceflight conditions, two spaceflight-analogue culture systems, i.e. the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and the random position machine (RPM), were used. Microarray analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment of the RWV compared to the normal gravity control (NG), revealed a regulatory role for AlgU (RpoE). Specifically, P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG exhibited increased alginate production and up-regulation of AlgU-controlled transcripts, including those encoding stress-related proteins. This study also shows the involvement of Hfq in the LSMMG response, consistent with its previously identified role in the Salmonella LSMMG- and spaceflight response. Furthermore, cultivation in LSMMG increased heat- and oxidative stress resistance and caused a decrease in the culture oxygen transfer rate. Interestingly, the global transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa grown in the RPM was similar to that in NG. The possible role of differences in fluid mixing between the RWV and RPM is discussed, with the overall collective data favoring the RWV as the optimal model to study the LSMMG-response of suspended cells. This study represents a first step towards the identification of specific virulence mechanisms of P. aeruginosa activated in response to spaceflight-analogue conditions, and could direct future research regarding the risk assessment and prevention of Pseudomonas infections for the crew in flight and the general public. The wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain (ATCC 15692) was used in this study and all cultures were grown in Lennox L Broth Base (LB) (Life Technologies) at 28 °C. An overnight shaking culture (125 r.p.m.) of P. aeruginosa in LB was washed and diluted in 0.85% NaCl solution to an OD600 of 1. This bacterial suspension was used to inoculate fresh LB medium at a final concentration of 10-4 CFU/ml. Synthecon Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactors (RWV) (50 ml or 10 ml) were filled with inoculated medium so that no headspace (i.e. no bubbles) was present. Other than for stress resistance assays, for which 10 ml capacity bioreactors were used, RWV bioreactors with a capacity of 50 ml were adopted for all experiments. Identical bioreactors were mounted in triplicate on (i) a RWV device in vertical position (LSMMG) (Cellon), (ii) a RWV device in horizontal position (NG) and (iii) the center of the inner Random Positioning Machine (RPM) frame (RG) (Fokker Space), and placed in a large humidified (70%-80% relative humidity) culture chamber, to avoid evaporation of culture medium through the gas-permeable membrane at the back of each vessel (Figure 1). A 25 r.p.m. rotation speed was adopted for the RWV cultures, while RPM-cultures were randomly rotated at 10 r.p.m. (60°/s). Bacteria were grown in the three described test conditions for 24 hours. After 24 hours of cultivation, the contents of every bioreactor was gently mixed by pipetting and divided into several aliquots. Ten millilitres of culture from each growth condition was immediately fixed with RNA Protect Reagent (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions, and fixed cell pellets were frozen at -20 °C until RNA extraction. Samples were immediately exposed to different stresses.

The two Fnr-type transcription factors Anr and Dnr regulate different parts of the underlying network. Both are proposed to bind to a non-distinguishable DNA sequence named Anr box. The aim of this study was the identification of genes induced under anaerobic conditions in the P. aeruginosa wild type and identification of genes under control of the Anr or Dnr regulators. We performed three comparisons to identify genes induced under anaerobic denitrifying conditions in the P. aeruginosa wild type strain and genes which are under control of the Anr or Dnr regulators under these anaerobic conditions. Since the anr and dnr mutant strains do not grow under anaerobic denitrifying conditions, we applied anaerobic shift experiments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown in a modified AB minimal medium, containing 25 µM FeSO4, 20 mM glucose and 50 mM NaNO3. The 200 ml aerobic cultures were grown in 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 oC and 300 rpm. The aerobic culture was grown to an OD578 of 0.3. For the aerobic culture, cells were harvested at this point. For the anaerobic shift experiments 130 ml of the respective aerobic culture were transferred to a 135 ml sealed serum flask. Control experiments verified that oxygen tension decreased within 3 - 5 min below the detection limit of an oxygen electrode. The cells were harvested after incubation for additional 2h under anaerobic conditions. Within these 2h incubation period no growth of the wild type, the anr mutant or the dnr mutant strain was observed. First comparison: Identification of genes induced or repressed under anaerobic conditions in the P. aeruginosa wild type PAO1. Here we compared the transcriptome profile of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown under aerobic conditions up to an OD578 of 0.3 with the transcriptome profile of the PAO1 strain, which was first grown under aerobic conditions up to an OD578 of 0.3 and than shifted to anaerobic conditions by transfer to a sealed serum flask and further incubated for two hours under anaerobic conditions. Second comparison: Identification of genes regulated differently in the anr mutant strain PAO6261. Here we compared the transcriptome profile of the P. aeruginosa wild type PAO1 with the transcriptome profile of the P. aeruginosa anr mutant strain PAO6261. Both strains were harvested after 2h incubation under anaerobic conditions. Third comparison: Identification of genes regulated differently in the dnr mutant strain RM536. Here we compared the transcriptome profile of the P. aeruginosa wild type PAO1 with the transcriptome profile of the P. aeruginosa dnr mutant strain RM536. Both strains were harvested after 2h incubation under anaerobic conditions.

Rep1	To assess the role of two redox-sensitive transcriptional regulators, RoxSR and ANR, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under aerobic conditions, microarray analysis was performed. Transcriptome profiles of roxSR mutant and anr mutant aerobically grown in LB medium were determined by Affymetrix GeneChip at both the exponential phase and early stationary phase and compared to that of the wild type strain. Experiment Overall Design: Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild type (PAO1ut), roxSR mutant (ROX1), and anr mutant (PAO6261) strains were cultivated aerobically in LB in Erlenmeyer flasks, and total RNAs were extracted at both the exponential phase (OD600 = 0.3) and early stationary phase (OD600 = 1.4). The experiment was performed in duplicate independent cultures.

Rep1	Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In vitro models that closely mimic CF sputum are needed to improve understanding of the pathobiology of P. aeruginosa in the CF airway. We developed an artificial sputum medium (ASMDM) that more closely resembles the composition of CF sputum than current media. In order to validate the utility of ASMDM, we used GeneChip microarrays to compare expression data of P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (PA14) in ASMDM with published data for this strain grown under the same conditions in an artificial medium containing 10% (v/v) CF sputum. Thirty-seven of 39 nutrition-related genes were differentially expressed in the same manner in both media. However, 24 quorum-sensing (QS) genes, 23 Type III secretion system and several anaerobic respiration genes were more highly expressed in ASMDM than in sputum-containing medium. When grown to stationary phase in ASMDM, PA14 differentially expressed about 50 biologically significant genes compared to stationary phase growth in Luria Broth; genes involved in iron acquisition (pfeA, fepC) and in assimilatory nitrate reduction (nasC, nirD) were upregulated, while 24 QS genes, including the regulator rhlR, lasA, rsaL, aprADEI and phenazine genes phzC2DD2EG2 were downregulated. Downregulation of QS-regulated virulence genes has been noted in chronic P. aeruginosa infection. ASMDM thus appears highly suitable for studies on gene expression of (i) P. aeruginosa strains from acutely and chronically infected CF patients and (ii) established biofilms that are a hallmark of advanced CF lung disease. PA14 was grown in four different ways: 1. Logarithmic growth for early gene expression Cells were grown in MOPS-Glucose and separately in ASMDM. The average of two biological duplicates in each case was compared to the other to determine differential gene expression. 2. Stationary phase growth for gene expression Cells were grown in Luria Broth and separately in ASMDM. The average of two biological duplicates in each case was compared to the other to determine differential gene expression.

However, indole and bacterial indole derivatives were unstable in microbial community due to the widespread of diverse oxygenases that could quickly degrade them. Hence, we sought to identify novel non-toxic, stable, and potent indole derivatives from plant sources for inhibiting biofilm formation of E. coli O157:H7 and P. aeruginosa PAO1. Here, plant auxin 3-indolylacetonitrile (IAN) was found to inhibit biofilm formation of both E. coli O157:H7 and P. aeruginosa without affecting its growth. IAN inhibited biofilms more effectively than indole for both E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Additionally, IAN decreased the production of virulence factor pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa. DNA microarray analysis indicated that IAN repressed genes involved in curli formation and glycerol metabolism, while IAN induced indole-related genes and prophage genes in E. coli. It appears that IAN inhibits biofilm formation of E. coli by reducing curli formation and inducing indole production. Furthermore, unlike bacterial indole derivatives, plant-originated IAN was stable in the presence of either E. coli or P. aeruginosa. For the microarray experiments, P. aeruginosa were inoculated in 25 ml of LB medium in 250 ml shake flasks with overnight cultures that were diluted 1:100. IAN (100 μg/ml) dissolved in 25 μl DMSO or 25 μl DMSO alone as a control was added. Cells were cultured in LB at 37C with 250 rpm shakingfor 5 hrs. Cells were immediately chilled with dry ice and 95% ethanol (to prevent RNA degradation) for 30 sec before centrifugation in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 13,000 g for 2 min; cell pellets were frozen immediately with dry ice and stored -80°C. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini Kit (Valencia, CA, USA). RNA quality was assessed by Agilent 2100 bioanalyser using the RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands), and quantity was determined by ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., DE, USA).

Planktonic in LB plus H2O2. Rep1	Phagocytosis and killing of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) is the major antipseudomonal host defense of vertebrates. By screening a transposon library of the clinical P. aeruginosa isolate TBCF10839 that can grow and replicate in PMNs, a mutant was identified that was most strongly sensitized to killing by PMNs. The inactivated gene PA1572 termed nadK1 was found to encode an ATP:NAD kinase. The transcriptomes of the TBCF10839 wild type and nadK1 mutant were investigated in the presence of PMNs or H2O2. Exposure to H2O2 led to diametrical mRNA expression profiles. H2O2-degrading enzymes were upregulated by wild type, but not by nadK1 mutant. This data demonstrates that NadK1 is crucial for the response of P. aeruginosa to reactive oxygen species. The transcriptomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa TBCF10839 wild type and nadK1 mutant were comparatively investigated in the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils or H2O2 in order to investigate the role of NadK1 in oxidative stress response. These samples represent test samples. The expression profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain TBCF10839 wild type cells, isolated from a Cystic Fibrosis patient, was investigated under standard growth conditions in batch culture in Luria broth (LB) with no treatment. These samples represent reference samples. All samples were analyzed in duplicate.

Upon infection, a single strain of P. aeruginosa can colonize an individual’s lungs throughout his or her lifetime. To understand the evolution of P. aeruginosa during chronic lung infection, we conducted both genotypic and phenotypic analyses on clinical isogenic strains obtained from the lungs of three different individuals with CF. These strains were isolated over a period of approximately ten years and possess phenotypes that are commonly observed in isolates from the CF lung, such as the antibiotic resistant dwarf and mucoid phenotypes. Microarray analyses were carried out on isolates grown in a chemically defined medium that mimics the nutritional environment of the CF lung, synthetic CF sputum medium (SCFM). 17 clinically isolated P. aeruginosa strains from three individuals with CF (5 strains from individual P1, 7 strains from individual P2, 5 strains from individual P3). Two reference strains PAO1 and PA14. All experiments were biologically duplicated.

Conventional applications of transcriptional profiling often compare two paired data sets that differ in a single experimentally controlled variable. In contrast this study obtained the transcriptome of a single biofilm state, ranked transcript signals to make the priorities of the population manifest, and compared rankings for a priori identified physiological marker genes between the biofilm and published data sets. Two drip flow biofilm conditions with three replicates each: (1) baseline control at 72hrs, (2) no treatment for 12 hours past baseline. Data from these two conditions were pooled

PAO1 grown 6 hours in LB with 1mM Lyngbyoic acid extract at 37 degrees with shaking, replicate 1	Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of bacterial gene regulation in response to increases in population density. Production of small molecule QS signals, their accumulation within a diffusion-limited environment and their binding to the LuxR-type receptor trigger QS-controlled gene regulatory cascades. QS pathways mediated by acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) in Gram-negative bacteria are the best studied. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for example, binding of AHLs to their cognate receptors (LasR, RhlR) controls production of virulence factors, pigments, antibiotics and other behaviors important for its interactions with eukaryotic hosts and other bacteria. We isolated a new small cyclopropane-containing fatty acid, lyngbyoic acid (1), as a major metabolite of the marine cyanobacterium, Lyngbya sp., collected off Fort Pierce, Florida. The structure of 1 was determined by NMR, MS and optical rotation. We screened 1 against four reporters based on AHL receptors from Vibrio fischeri (LuxR), Aeromonas hydrophila (AhyR), Agrobacterium tumefaciens (TraR) and P. aeruginosa (LasR) and found that 1 most strongly affected LasR. We show, by using a defined set of reporters, that compound 1 acts both through the AHL-binding site of LasR and independent of it. We also show that 1 reduces pyocyanin and LasB, both on the protein and transcript level, in wild-type P. aeruginosa, and that 1 directly inhibits LasB enzymatic activity. Conversely, dodecanoic acid (11) increased pyocanin and LasB, demonstrating that 1 is a “tagged” fatty acid potentially resistant to β-oxidation. 1 mL Cultures of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were grown for 6h at 37 °C with shaking either in the presence of lyngbyoic acid (1 mM) or EtOH alone (10 μL) as a control. RNA samples were obtained from one treated and one control culture, and were reverse transcribed, labeled and fragmented according to Affymetrix's protocol. The two samples were hybridized in duplicate.

Rep1	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a threatening, opportunistic pathogen causing disease in immunocompromised individuals. The hallmark of P. aeruginosa virulence is its multi-factorial and combinatorial nature. It renders such bacteria infectious for many organisms and it is often resistant to antibiotics. To gain insights into the physiology of P. aeruginosa during infection, we assessed the transcriptional programs of three different P. aeruginosa strains directly after isolation from burn wounds of humans. We compared the programs to those of the same strains using two infection models: a plant model, which consisted of the infection of the midrib of lettuce leaves, and a murine tumor model, which was obtained by infection of mice with an induced tumor in the abdomen. All control conditions of P. aeruginosa cells growing in suspension and as a biofilm were added to the analysis. We found that these different P. aeruginosa strains express a pool of distinct genetic traits that are activated under particular infection conditions regardless of their genetic variability. The knowledge herein generated will advance our understanding of P. aeruginosa virulence and provide valuable cues for the definition of prospective targets to develop novel intervention strategies. Samples collected from human burn wounds were stabilized and used for P. aeruginosa RNA extraction. The strains from burn wound infection were later used for infection models namely plant and murine tumor infection as well as rich medium controls with planctonic and biofilm growth. The RNA was treated for bacterial RNA enrichment and amplification. All samples were treated in the same way.

The oxidative stress response encapsulates several strategies to overcome the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species. However, many of the regulatory components and associated molecular mechanisms underpinning this key adaptive response remain to be characterised. Comparative analysis of publically available transcriptomic datasets led to the identification of a novel LTTR, PA2206, whose expression was altered in response to a range of host signals in addition to oxidative stress. PA2206 was found to be required for tolerance to H2O2 in vitro and lethality in vivo in the Zebrafish embryo model of infection. Transcriptomic analysis in the presence of H2O2 showed that PA2206 altered the expression of 58 genes, including a large repertoire of oxidative stress and iron responsive genes, independent of the master regulator of oxidative stress, OxyR. Contrary to the classic mechanism of LysR regulation, PA2206 did not autoregulate its own expression and did not influence expression of adjacent or divergently transcribed genes. The PA2214-15 operon was identified as a direct target of PA2206 with truncated promoter fragments revealing binding to the 5’-ATTGCCTGGGGTTAT-3’ LysR box adjacent to the predicted -35 region. PA2206 also interacted with the pvdS promoter suggesting a global dimension to the PA2206 regulon, and suggests PA2206 is an important regulatory component of P. aeruginosa adaptation during oxidative stress.

Some of them, like PQS and HHQ, were found to be important signal that control the virulence of the bacteria. We have discover that one of the most abandon molecule produced by the pqs operon, 2 aminoacetophenone (2-AA), a volatile molecule serves as a unique signal. In contrast to the previous described PQS and HHQ, 2-AA is downregulating virulence and acute phase proteins and upregulating chronic phase proteins. In addition we have found that 2-AA promotes the formation of persisters cells that antibiotic tolerant. we have compared the genes profile of wild-type PA14 strain and its derivatives topA which lacks Topoisomerase I and pqsA that do not produces HAQs or 2-AA to cultures that were treated with 3mM of 2-AA. Cell were grown with and without 2-AA (3mM) to OD 2.0.

During early infection P. aeruginosa produces multiple virulence factors, which cause acute pulmonary disease and are largely regulated by quorum sensing (QS) intercellular signalling networks. Longitudinal clinical studies have observed the loss, through adaptive mutation, of QS and QS-related virulence in late chronic infection. Although the mechanisms are not understood, infection with QS mutants has been linked to a worse outcome for CF patients. By comparing QS-active and QS-inactive P. aeruginosa CF isolates, we have identified novel virulence factors and pathways associated with QS disruption. In particular, we noted factors implicating increased intra-phagocyte survival. Our data present novel targets as candidates for future CF therapies. Some of these targets are already the subject of drug development programmes for the treatment of other bacterial pathogens and may provide cross-over benefit to the CF population.

Standing genetic variation, which depends on rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and mutation supply, controls response to challenges. HGT may increase if new clones successfully invade, while mutator strains increase new mutations. We sought to ascertain genomic signatures of invasion and whether, in the absence of novel invasion, mutator-containing P. aeruginosa populations from chronically infected CF lung are more genetically variable than nonmutator populations. Forty-nine strains from 14 patients treated over three years at Necker Children’s Hospital in Paris were phenotyped for antibiotic resistance, mucoidy and mutator status, and then genotyped by rep-PCR, PFGE and MLST analysis. Overall, strains exhibited greater genetic similarity within patients than among patients, with initial and terminal clones differing markedly between series, indicating unrelated clones independently established infections and resisted invasions that might enlarge genetic variation by sexual recombination. Mutator series were more likely to be multiply antibiotic-resistant, but were no more genetically variable at the single nucleotide level. DNA microarray analyses of bacterial genomes in two longitudinal series of equal duration, one containing and one lacking mutators, revealed both series conspicuously lack genes encoding proteins involved in attachment, motility and amino acid biosynthesis. The mutator series also contained fewer genes hybridizing to canonical PAO1 genome sequences. These data suggest genetic variation arising from mutators may be limited in scope, transient in nature or not easily resolved by fingerprinting, MLST or comparative genomic analyses.

Moreover, regulation by small trans-encoded RNAs has become a focal issue in virulence gene expression of bacterial pathogens. In this study, we have identified the small RNA PhrS as an activator of PqsR synthesis, one of the key quorum sensing regulators in P. aeruginosa. Genetic studies revealed a novel mode of regulation by a sRNA, whereby PhrS uses a base-pairing mechanism to activate a short upstream open reading frame to which the pqsR gene is translationally coupled. Expression of phrS is induced by the oxygen-responsive regulator ANR when the oxygen supply decreases. Thus, PhrS is the first bacterial sRNA that provides a regulatory link between oxygen availability and quorum sensing, which may impact on oxygen-limited growth in P. aeruginosa biofilms.

During the course of an infection, P. aeruginosa rapidly adapts to the specific conditions within the host. In the present study, we aimed at the identification of genes that are highly expressed during biofilm infections such as in chronically infected lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), burn wounds and subcutaneous mouse tumours. We found a common subset of differentially regulated genes in all three in vivo habitats and evaluated whether their inactivation impacts on the bacterial capability to form biofilms in vitro and to establish biofilm-associated infections in a murine model. Additive effects on biofilm formation and host colonization were discovered by the combined inactivation of several highly expressed genes. However, even combined inactivation was not sufficient to abolish the establishment of an infection completely. These findings can be interpreted as evidence that either redundant traits encode functions that are essential for in vivo survival and chronic biofilm infections and/or bacterial adaptation is considerably achieved independently of transcription levels. Supplemental screens, will have to be applied in order to identify the minimal set of key genes essential for the establishment of chronic infectious diseases. Ex-vivo samples were collected from burn wound, cystic fibrosis patients mucous and mice tumor and stabilized for the RNA extraction. Recovered clinical strains were cultivated in rich medium control conditions untill the early stationary phase and RNA was extracted. The murine tumors were infected with burn wound isolated strains

A major outstanding question is the degree to which the biofilm-specific cellular state and its constituent genetic determinants contribute to this hyper-tolerant phenotype. Here, using genome-wide functional profiling of a complex, heterogeneous mutant population of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1, we identified large sets of mutations that contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or planktonic setting only. Our mixed population-based experimental design recapitulated the complexity of natural biofilms and, unlike previous studies, revealed clinically observed behaviors including the emergence of quorum sensing-deficient mutants. Our study revealed a substantial contribution of the cellular state to the antibiotic tolerance of biofilms, providing a rational foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections. This dataset compares the expression of SAH108, a strain with enhanced antibiotic tolerance in the biofilm state, to expression in wild-type strains. We compared the expression of two biological replicates from strain SAH108 to samples from three wild-type, reference strains. All samples were collected from exponentially-growing planktonic cultures.

In contrast, genes associated with pyrimidine synthesis were unaffected. Competition experiments in both planktonic and biofilm cultures, using three purine synthesis mutants, purD, purH, and purT showed little difference in E. coli survival from the parent strain. As purines are components of the cell signals, cAMP and c-di-GMP, we conducted competition experiments with E. coli mutants lacking adenylate cyclase (cyaA), cAMP phosphodiesterase (cpdA), and the catabolite receptor protein (crp), as well as ydeH, an uncharacterized gene that has been associated with c-di-GMP synthesis. Survival of the cyaA and crp mutants during co-culture were significantly less than the parent strain. Supplementation of the media with 1mM cAMP could restore survival of the cyaA mutant but not the crp mutant. In contrast, survival of the cpdA mutant was similar to the parent strain. Survival of the ydeH mutant was moderately less than the parent, suggesting that cAMP has more impact on E. coli mixed culture growth than c-di-GMP. Addition of 1 mM indole restored the survival of both the cyaA and crp mutations. Mutants in genes for tryptophan synthesis (trpE) and indole production (tnaA) showed a loss of competition and recovery through indole supplementation, comparable to the cyaA and crp mutants. Overall, these results suggest indole and cAMP as major contributing factors to E. coli growth in mixed culture.

Outside the laboratory, the bacteria live in complex communities where signals may be perceived across species. We here present a newly found natural quorum sensing inhibitor, produced by the pseudomonads Pseudomonas sp. B13 and Pseudomonas reinekei MT1 as a blind end in the biodegradation of organochloride xenobiotics, which inhibits quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa in naturally occurring concentrations. This catabolite, 4-methylenebut-2-en-4-olide, also known as protoanemonin, has been reported to possess antibacterial properties, but seems to have dual functions. Using transcriptomics and proteomics, we found that protoanemonin significantly reduced expression of genes and secretion of proteins known to be under control of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa. Moreover, we found activation of genes and gene products involved in iron starvation response. It is thus likely that inhibition of quorum sensing, as the production of antibiotics, is a phenomenon found in complex bacterial communities.

While most antibiotics that primarily aim to inhibit cell growth may result in bacterial drug resistance, biofilm inhibitors do not affect cell growth and there is less chance of developing resistance. This work sought to identify novel, non-toxic and potent biofilm inhibitors from Streptomyces bacteria for reducing the biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Out of 4300 Streptomyces strains, one species produced and secreted peptide(s) to inhibit P. aeruginosa biofilm formation by 93% without affecting the growth of planktonic cells. Global transcriptome analyses (DNA microarray) revealed that the supernatant of the Streptomyces 230 strain induced phenazine, pyoverdine, and pyochelin synthesis genes. Electron microscopy showed that the supernatant of Streptomyces 230 strain reduced the production of polymeric matrix in P. aeruginosa biofilm cells, while the Streptomyces species enhanced swarming motility of P. aeruginosa. Therefore, current study suggests that Streptomyces bacteria are an important resource of biofilm inhibitors as well as antibiotics.

In the present study, PA2384 is shown by bioinformatics analysis to have a weak similarity to the N-termini DNA binding domain of fur, a well-known ferric uptake regulator. To experimentally investigate the function of PA2384 P. aeruginosa PAO1 recombinant (pUCP20::PA2384) overexpressing PA2384 and PA2384 knock-out mutant PAO1-23844 are constructed and studied. Physiological characterization in a carefully controlled cultivation system shows that the knockout strain needed a longer lag phase to grow and exhibited a significantly reduced production speed of siderophore (pyoverdine and pyochelin) in the stationary phase. Genome-scale transcriptional profiles at different growth stages are compared between the wild type and ∆PA2384 mutant grown under iron-limiting conditions. The expression of more than 350 genes is affected. Among them, seventy-one genes involved in iron uptake are significantly induced by PA2384. 102 quorum sensing (QS) dependent genes exhibited differential transcription. They include genes related to the biosynthesis of some important virulence factors such as pyocyanin, rhamnolipids and hydrogen cyanide. Transcription of genes responsible for the synthesis of Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) is greatly advanced by the knockout of PA2384. We postulate that PA2384 affects QS via PQS. Furthermore, the knockout of PA2384 also results in altered expression of genes involved in electron transfer, central metabolism, phosphorus starvation and translation. It implies that PA2384 may affect more basic physiology than only respond to iron uptake and is a versatile global regulator in P. aeruginosa under iron starvation. Experiment Overall Design: mutant and wilde type biological replicates were analyzed at 3 timepoints

Here we demonstrate that the spatial and temporal release of eDNA is regulated by BfmR, a regulator essential for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development. The expression of bfmR coincided with localized cell death and DNA release, with high eDNA concentrations localized to the outer part of microcolonies in the form of a ring and as a cap on small clusters. Additionally, eDNA release and cell lysis increased significantly following bfmR inactivation. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling indicated that bfmR was required for repression of genes associated with bacteriophage assembly and bacteriophage-mediated lysis. In order to determine which of these genes were directly regulated by BfmR, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis to identify the promoter of PA0691, termed here phdA, encoding a previously undescribed homologue of the prevent-host-death (Phd) family of proteins. Lack of phdA expression coincided with impaired biofilm development, increased cell death and bacteriophage release, a phenotype comparable to ΔbfmR. Expression of phdA in ΔbfmR biofilms restored eDNA release, cell lysis, release of bacteriophages, and biofilm formation to wild type levels. Moreover, overexpression of phdA rendered P. aeruginosa resistant to lysis mediated by superinfective bacteriophage Pf4 which was only detected in biofilms. The expression of bfmR was stimulated by conditions resulting in membrane perturbation and cell lysis. Thus, we propose that BfmR regulates biofilm development by controlling bacteriophage-mediated lysis and thus, cell death and eDNA release, via PhdA.

When the human intestine is exposed to extreme medical interventions, the normal flora becomes replaced by pathogenic species whose virulence can be triggered by various physico-chemical cues leading to lethal sepsis. We previously demonstrated that phosphate depletion develops in the mouse intestine following surgical injury and triggers intestinal P. aeruginosa to express a lethal phenotype that can be prevented by oral phosphate ([Pi]) supplementation. We used a microarray to define the virulence-related genes in P. aeruginosa grown as lawns on NGM at pH7.5 vs pH6.0 All samples for gene expression analysis were prepared in triplicate. P. aeruginosa MPAO1 cells collected from lawns grown on NGM/[Pi]25 mM, pH 6.0 or NGM/[Pi]25, pH 7.5 were used for RNA isolation as previously described.

We found here that mutation in glyA2 (PA2444), which encodes a serine hydroxymethyltransferase, leads to the RSCV phenotype. The phenotype is related to increased c-di-GMP concentrations and depends on an active Wsp chemosensory system, including a diguanylate cyclase WspR. By characterizing the PA2444 enzyme both in vivo and in vitro, we determined the physiological function of PA2444 and related the enzyme to S-adenosylmethionine concentrations and the methylation of a membrane bound methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein WspA. A transcriptome analysis revealed the possible relationship between PA2444 and the redox state of the cells. Hence, we provide a mechanism for how an enzyme of central metabolism controls the community behavior of the bacterium. The P. aeruginosa genome array (Affymetrix, P/N 510596) was used to investigate differential gene expression in biofilm cells between PA14 and the PA2444 mutant. Biofilm cells were harvested from 10 g of glass wool after incubation for 7 h in LB with shaking at 250 rpm, and RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using a bead beater (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK ) with RNAlater buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to stabilize the RNA. For each binary microarray comparison of differential genes expression, if the gene with the larger transcription rate did not have a consistent transcription rate based on the 13 probe pairs (P-value less than 0.05), these genes were discarded. A gene was considered differentially expressed when the P-value for comparing two chips was lower than 0.05 (to assure that the change in gene expression was statistically significant and that false positives arise less than 5%) and when the expression ratio was higher than the standard deviation for the whole microarrays (1.8 for PA14 wild-type and PA2444).

Some of these genes, for instance, control antibiotic resistance. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying biofilm formation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells were grown as planktonic cells in LB broth for 4 hours (PC4) or 24 hours (PC24) and sessile cels for 24 hours.

P. aeruginosa responds with adaptive and protective strategies against these toxic species to effectively infect humans. Despite advances in our understanding of the responses to oxidative stress in many specific cases, the connectivity between targeted protective genes and the rest of cell metabolism remains obscure. Results: Herein, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the cellular responses to hydrogen peroxide in order to determine a more complete picture of how oxidative stress-induced genes are related and regulated. Our data reinforce the previous conclusion that DNA repair proteins and catalases may be among the most vital antioxidant defense systems of P. aeruginosa. Our results also suggest that sublethal oxidative damage reduces active and/or facilitated transport and that intracellular iron might be a key factor for a relationship between oxidative stress and iron regulation. Perhaps most intriguingly, we revealed that the transcription of all F-, R-, and S-type pyocins was upregulated by oxidative stress and at the same time, a cell immunity protein (pyocin S2 immunity protein) was downregulated, possibly leading to self-killing activity. Conclusions: This finding proposes that pyocin production might be another novel defensive scheme against oxidative attack by host cells. Experiment Overall Design: We conducted four and five independent microarray experiments with biological replicates in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of hydrogen peroxide, respectively.

Rep1	CF patients suffer from chronic and recurrent respiratory tract infections which eventually lead to lung failure followed by death. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the major pathogens for CF patients and is the principal cause of mortality and morbidity in CF patients. Once it gets adapted, P. aeruginosa can persist for several decades in the respiratory tracts of CF patients, overcoming host defense mechanisms as well as intensive antibiotic therapies. P. aeruginosa CF strains isolated from different infection stage were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Two batch of P. aeruginosa CF isolates are chosen : 1) isolates from a group of patients since 1973-2008 as described in ref (PMID: 21518885); 2) isolates from a group of newly infected children as described in ref (PMID: 20406284).

To unravel the adaptation strategies of P. aeruginosa to the conditions in the urinary tract and to define the underlying regulatory network an artificial growth system mimicking the conditions in the urinary tract was established. Transcriptome analyses were used to investigate the physiological status of P. aeruginosa under this conditions. We performed comparisons to identify genes induced under artificial urinary tract conditions to unravel the adaptive strategies and the underlying regulatory network used by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during urinary tract infections using Affimetrix GeneChips. Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild type strain PAO1 was grown in an artificial in vitro growth system mimicking the conditions in the urinary tract. Therefore, biofilms were grown on the surface of membrane filters placed on agar plates at 37 °C up to the late logarithmic state under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (incubated in an anaerobic beanch). An artificial urine medium (AUM) simulating the averaged urine of an human adult was used as nutrient souce. 10-fold diluted Luria Bertani (LB)-medium was used as reference medium. For growth under oxygen depletion the media were supplemented with 50 mM KNO3 to sustain anaerobic respiration. The biofilms were harveted at this time points and resuspsended in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. The OD578 of biofilm suspension was 0.8 for all tested conditions. First comparison: Identification of genes induced or repressed under aerobic conditions in the P. aeruginosa wild type PAO1. Here we compared the transcriptome profile of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown aerobically for 18 h to the late logarithmic phase in biofilms on AUM with the transcriptome profile of the PAO1 strain, which was grown aerobically for 18 h to the late logarithmic phase in biofilms on 10-fold diluted LB. Second comparison: Identification of genes induced or repressed under anaerobic conditions in the P. aeruginosa wild type PAO1. Here we compared the transcriptome profile of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown anaerobically for 2 days up to the late logarithmic phase in biofilms on AUM supplemented with 50 mM nitrate with the transcriptome profile of the PAO1 strain, which was grown anaerobically for 2 days up to the late logarithmic phase in biofilms on 10-fold diluted LB supplemented with 50 mM nitrate.

Studies have demonstrated that in addition to regulating ampC expression, AmpR also regulates the expression of the sigma factor AlgT/U and the production of some quorum-sensing regulated virulence factors. In order to understand the ampR regulon, we compared the expression profiles of PAO1 and its isogenic ampR mutant, PAO∆ampR in the presence and absence of sub-MIC ß-lactam stress. The analysis demonstrates that the ampR regulon is much more extensive than previously thought, with the deletion of ampR affecting the expression of over 300 genes. Expression of an additional 207 genes are affected by AmpR when the cells are exposed to sub-MIC ß-lactam stress, indicating that the ampR regulon in P. aeruginosa is much more extensive than previously thought. An inframe deletion of ampR was generated in P. aeruginosa PAO1. The wild type and ampR mutant strains were grown to mid-log phase and subjected to sub-MIC ß-lactam exposure. Total RNA was isolated from 2-hour ß-lactam exposed and unexposed cells to monitor changes in gene expression arising due to loss of ampR in the presence and absence of ß-lactam exposure.

Nevertheless, the uptake and utilization of these compounds is organized in a hierarchical manner, which is guaranteed by a mechanism named catabolite repression. In P. aeruginosa catabolite repression is a post-transcriptional process with the translational repressor protein, Crc, as the main component. Crc recognizes CA-motifs (acronym for catabolite activity) present in the vicinity of the ribosome binfing site of corresponding target mRNAs and therefore compete with ribosome binding. Certain conditions, which are mainly related to changes in the carbon to nitrogen ratio, induce the two component system CbrAB, which activates the transcription of the sRNA CrcZ. The sRNA sequesters Crc and allows the translation of the target mRNAs. The main focus of this study was to identify novel direct targets of the CbrAB/Crc system with the use of a transcriptome analysis in combination with the search for CA-motifs.

Nevertheless, the uptake and utilization of these compounds is organized in a hierarchical manner, which is guaranteed by a mechanism named catabolite repression. In P. aeruginosa catabolite repression is a post-transcriptional process with the translational repressor protein, Crc, as the main component. Crc recognizes CA-motifs (acronym for catabolite activity) present in the vicinity of the ribosome binfing site of corresponding target mRNAs and therefore compete with ribosome binding. Certain conditions, which are mainly related to changes in the carbon to nitrogen ratio, induce the two component system CbrAB, which activates the transcription of the sRNA CrcZ. The sRNA sequesters Crc and allows the translation of the target mRNAs. The main focus of this study was to identify novel direct targets of the CbrAB/Crc system with the use of a transcriptome analysis in combination with the search for CA-motifs. We were able to identify five novel targets (estA, acsA, dctP, bkdR and aroP2), which were involved in the uptake and utilization of less preferred carbon sources and amino acids. Direct interaction of Crc with these genes and the resulting regulation by CbrB and CrcZ were verified using mutational analysis and in vitro and in vivo experiments.

The uptake and catabolism of growth substrates are organized hierarchically by a mechanism termed catabolite repression control (Crc) whereby the Crc protein establishes translational repression of target mRNAs at CA (catabolite activity) motifs present in target mRNAs near ribosome binding sites. Poor carbon sources lead to activation of the CbrAB two-component system, which induces transcription of the small RNA (sRNA) CrcZ. This sRNA relieves Crc-mediated repression of target mRNAs. In this study, we have identified novel targets of the CbrAB/Crc system in P. aeruginosa using transcriptome analysis in combination with a search for CA motifs. We characterized four target genes involved in the uptake and utilization of less preferred carbon sources: estA (secreted esterase), acsA (acetyl-CoA synthetase), bkdR (regulator of branched-chain amino acid catabolism) and aroP2 (aromatic amino acid uptake protein). Evidence for regulation by CbrAB, CrcZ and Crc was obtained in vivo using appropriate reporter fusions, in which mutation of the CA motif resulted in loss of catabolite repression. CbrB and CrcZ were important for growth of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) sputum medium, suggesting that the CbrAB/Crc system may act as an important regulator during chronic infection of the CF lung.

P. aeruginosa isolate CJ-1d grown on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) (replicate A)	Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) lung infection is a significant cause of mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Existing experimental data in our lab showed significantly different levels of virulence of "early" and "late" P. aeruginosa infection isolates in a C. elegans slow killing model. We wished to examine the expression profile of these isolates in order to explore genes that may be responsible for the observed differences. The expression profiles of two pairs of isolates (four isolates in total) were compared to each other using the Affymetrix P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome array, to gain insight into properties mediating virulence in these isolates. Data analysis was carried out using BIOCONDUCTOR software.

Bacteria coordinate the response to oxidative stress through the LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) OxyR. Extensive studies have focused on the classical Escherichia coli system to shed light on the mode of action of defensive weapons against oxidative stress. The underlying mechanism is mediated via the formation of redox-dependent disulfide bond between two conserved cysteines of OxyR, thus activating transcription of members of the OxyR regulon. However, only fragmentary information on the regulation and function of OxyR has been gleaned through genetic and biochemical analyses in the important opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa. In this report, we used a comprehensive transcriptional profiling analysis to delineate the OxyR regulon under three conditions (King’s A medium [Pseudomonas medium or PM], Luria Broth (LB), and LB when oxyR is overexpressed), to investigate its roles in different cellular aspects that are independent of the classical oxidative stress response. Interestingly, when grown in LB, OxyR was found to regulating many genes involved in the process of inter-cellular communication known as quorum sensing (QS). In contrast, when grown in PM, OxyR regulate the expression of a newly identified CSS (cell-surface signaling) system in an OxyR-dependent fashion. In addition, the results from oxyR overexpression further confirmed that OxyR was linked to regulation of QS and Type 3 Secretion (T3SS) in addition to the regulation of antioxidative genes. Taken together, our results show that, apart from its dominant role in defense against oxidative stress in P. aeruginosa, OxyR acts as a global regulator that provides a link between the regulation of oxidative stress response, QS and virulence. 15 samples, representing 5 different biological conditions, including 3 biological replicates for each condition

It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms at the basis of this phenotypic switch. Methodology/Principal findings One SCV (termed PAO-SCV) was isolated, showing high resistance to gentamicin and to the cephalosporine cefotaxime. PAO-SCV was prone to reversion as evidenced by emergence of large colonies with a frequency of 10-5 on media without antibiotics while it was stably maintained in presence of gentamicin. PAO-SCV showed a delayed growth, defective motility, and strongly reduced levels of the quorum sensing Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). Whole genome expression analysis further suggested a multi-layered antibiotic resistance mechanism, including simultaneous over-expression of two drug efflux pumps (MexAB-OprM, MexXY-OprM), the LPS modification operon arnBCADTEF, and the PhoP-PhoQ two-component system. Conversely, the genes for the synthesis of PQS were strongly down-regulated in PAOSCV. Finally, genomic analysis revealed the presence of mutations in phoP and phoQ genes as well as in the mexZ gene encoding a repressor of the mexXY and mexABoprM genes. Only one mutation occurred only in REV, at nucleotide 1020 of the tufA gene, a paralog of tufB, both encoding the elongation factor Tu, causing a change of the rarely used aspartic acid codon GAU to the more common GAC, possibly causing an increase of tufA mRNA translation. High expression of phoP and phoQ was confirmed for the SCV variant while the revertant showed expression levels reduced to wild-type levels. Conclusions By combining data coming from phenotypic, gene expression and proteome analysis, we could demonstrate that resistance to aminoglycosides in one SCV mutant is multifactorial including overexpression of efflux mechanisms, LPS modification and is accompanied by a drastic down-regulation of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal quorum sensing system. We used microarrays to study changes in gene expression during early and late stationary phase of SCV and WT strains. SCV and WT cultures were grown in triplicate until early (24h) and late (48h) stationary phase. RNA was extracted, labelled and hybridised on Affymetrix P. aeruginosa expression microarrays.

Here, we characterized the local transcriptional responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa growing in biofilms by using microarray analysis of isolated biofilm subpopulations. The results demonstrated that cells at the top of the biofilms had high mRNA abundances for genes involved in general metabolic functions, while mRNAs for these housekeeping genes were low in cells at the bottom of the biofilms. Selective GFP labeling showed that cells at the top of the biofilm were actively dividing. However, the dividing cells had high mRNAs levels for genes regulated by the hypoxia induced regulator, Anr. Slow-growing cells deep in the biofilms had little expression of Anr-regulated genes and may have experienced long-termanoxia. Transcripts for ribosomal proteins were primarily associated with the metabolically active cell fraction, while ribosomal RNAs were abundant throughout the biofilms, indicating that ribosomes are stably maintained even in slowly growing cells. Consistent with these results was the identification of mRNAs for ribosome hibernation factors (rmf and PA4463) at the bottom of the biofilms. A P. aeruginosa ∆rmf strain had increased uptake of the membrane integrity stain, propidium iodide. Using selective GFP labeling and cell sorting, we showed that the dividing cells were more susceptible to tobramycin and ciprofloxacin than the dormant subpopulation. The results demonstrate that in thick P. aeruginosa biofilms, cells are physiologically distinct spatially, with cells deep in the biofilm in a viable but antibiotic-tolerant slow-growth state. 52-hour Pseudomonas aeruginosa TSA colony biofilms were cryoembedded, thin sectioned, and laser dissected (LCM) to obtain samples from the top and bottom 50 µm of the biofilms. 9 sections per biofilm were pooled. RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Micro kit, Turbo DNase treated, poly(A) tailed, and amplified using the Quantitect WTA kit. After clean up, the resulting product was fragmented and end labeled before hybridization.

Understanding the mechanism of cell shape change induced upon anaerobiosis is crucial to the development of effective treatments against P. aeruginosa biofilm infection. Anaerobic growth of PAO1 reached higher cell density in the presence of vitamin B12, an essential coenzyme of class II ribonucleotide reductase. In addition, cell morphology returned to a normal rod shape. These results suggest that vitamin B12, the production of which was suppressed during anaerobic growth, can restore cellular machineries for DNA replication and therefore facilitate better anaerobic growth of P. aeruginosa with normal cell division. We used microarray to elucidate the global gene expression profiles underlying vitamin B12-induced changes in bacterial cell shape and growth-associated properties. Gene expression profiles of PAO1 grown in LBN (LB+NO3-) or LBN supplemented with 1 microM vitamin B12 are compared.

Alginate biosynthesis in this bacterium is initiated by the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor (σ22, AlgU/T). In the wild type (wt) nonmucoid strains, such as PAO1, AlgU is sequestered by the anti-sigma factor MucA that inhibits alginate production. However, the degradation of MucA by activated intramembrane proteases AlgW and/or MucP can lead to the conversion from nonmucoid strains to mucoid. Previously we reported that the absence of the sensor kinase KinB in PAO1 causes the initiation of AlgW-dependent proteolysis of MucA resulting in alginate overproduction. In the kinB mutant this activation requires alternate sigma factor RpoN (σ54). To determine the RpoN-dependent KinB regulon, microarray and proteomic analyses were performed on a mucoid kinB mutant and an isogenic nonmucoid kinB rpoN double mutant. In the kinB mutant, RpoN controlled the expression of approximately 20% of the genome. Besides alginate biosynthesis and regulator genes such as AlgW, KinB, in concert with RpoN, also control a large number of genes including: those involved in carbohydrate metabolism, quorum sensing, iron regulation, rhamnolipid production, and motility. In an acute pneumonia murine infection model, mice exhibited better survival when challenged with the kinB mutant than wt PAO1. Together, these data strongly suggest that KinB controls virulence factors important for acute pneumonia and conversion to mucoidy.

E-GEOD-35286	GSM717419 1	GSM717419.CEL	PAO1	WT							biofilm		RNA		6 days			A hallmark of the biofilm architecture is the presence of microcolonies. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms governing microcolony formation. In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, microcolony formation is dependent on the two-component regulator MifR, with mifR mutant biofilms exhibiting an overall thin structure lacking microcolonies, and overexpression of mifR resulting in hyper-microcolony formation. Here, we made use of the distinct MifR-dependent phenotypes to elucidate mechanisms associated with microcolony formation. Using global transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we demonstrate that cells located within microcolonies experience stressful, oxygen limited, and energy starving conditions, as indicated by the activation of stress response mechanisms and anaerobic and fermentative processes, in particular pyruvate fermentation. Inactivation of genes involved in pyruvate utilization including uspK, acnA and ldhA abrogated microcolony formation in a manner similar to mifR inactivation. Moreover, depletion of pyruvate from the growth medium impaired biofilm and microcolony formation, while addition of pyruvate significantly increased microcolony formation. Addition of pyruvate partly restored microcolony formation in ∆mifR biofilms. Moreover, addition of pyruvate to or expression of mifR in lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) mutant biofilms did not restore microcolony formation. Consistent with the finding of denitrification genes not demonstrating distinct expression patterns in biofilms forming or lacking microcolonies, addition of nitrate did not alter microcolony formation. Our findings indicate the fermentative utilization of pyruvate to be a microcolony-specific adaptation to the oxygen limitation and energy starvation of the P. aeruginosa biofilm environment. For biofilm growth experiments, three independent replicates of P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and ΔmifR were grown as biofilms in a flow-through system using a once-through continuous flow tube reactor system for biofilm sample collection and in flow cells (BioSurface Technologies) for the analysis of biofilm architecture as previously described (Sauer et al., 2002, Sauer et al., 2004, Petrova & Sauer, 2009). Cells were treated with RNAprotect (Qiagen) and total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini purification kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality and the presence of residual DNA were checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 electrophoretic system pre- and post-DNase treatment. Ten micrograms of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, and labeling according to the Affymetrix GeneChip P. aeruginosa genome array expression analysis protocol. Sauer, K., A. K.

We constructed a small peptide termed the RpoN molecular roadblock, which binds to and blocks transcription from RpoN promoters. This RpoN molecular roadblock can be used in any bacterium to obtain information on the RpoN regulon. We expressed the RpoN molecular roadblock in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and used microarrays to identify genes that were differentially transcribed due to the RpoN molecular roadblock. The RpoN molecular roadblock was expressed in P. aeruginosa PAO1 in mid-exponential phase in rich media. Total RNA was isolated and prepped for Affymetrix GeneChips.

Recently, a third bacterial signal molecule, the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), has been identified, which positively regulates a subset of genes dependent on the QS systems. To further dissect the various independent regulation levels for many QS induced genes and to evaluate the impact of PQS on the QS circuitry, we performed a transcriptome analysis of PAO1 cultures supplemented with PQS. The global transcriptional profile in response to PQS revealed a marked up-regulation of genes belonging to the tightly interdependent functional groups of iron acquisition and oxidative stress response. Remarkably, not only most of the differentially regulated genes but also the induction of a lacZ transcriptional fusion of rhlR could be traced back to a iron chelating effect of PQS. Nevertheless, although iron deficiency per se induced rhlR, there seems to be PQS specific effects that are independent of the PQS effect on P. aeruginosa iron homeostasis

We examined the regulon controlled by PA2449 via microarray analysis between wild-type P. aeruignosa PAO1 and the PA2449-null mutant P. aeruginosa PW5126. Both strains were obtained from the PA-two allele library (Univ. of Washington, Ref. Jacobs et al. 2003. PNAS 100, 14339). Strains were grown under conditions known to induce phenazine biosynthesis (peptone broth), and their resulting transcriptomes were compared. Total RNA was isolated and prepped for Affymetrix GeneChips.

Our analysis revealed that QscR activates some genes and represses others. Some of the repressed genes are not regulated by the LasR-I or RhlR-I systems while others are. The LasI-generated 3-oxododecanoyl-homoserine lactone serves as a signal molecule for QscR. Thus QscR appears to be an integral component of the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing circuitry. QscR uses the LasI-generated acyl-homoserine lactone signal and controls a specific regulon that overlaps with the already overlapping LasR and RhlR-dependent regulons. Experiment Overall Design: First comparisaon Experiment Overall Design: We first compared transcriptomes of the qscR mutant P. aeruginosa PAO-R3 and the parental strain PAO1 at several points during growth (OD600nm 0.5, 0.8, 1.4, 2.0 and 3.5). To identify those genes with expression significantly different between PAO1 and PAO-R3 at different culture densities we used CYBER-T. The Bayesian prior estimate was 10 and the sliding window size was 101. The p-value threshold was 0.001, the posterior probability of differential expression >0.95, and fold change was >2.5. Experiment Overall Design: Second comparison Experiment Overall Design: We selected genes that were at least 3-fold differentially expressed in the strain containing the L-arabinose promoter-driven qscR allele vs the strain containing L-arabinose promoter-driven qscR-Ddbd allele, and were also at least 3-fold differentially expressed in the parent strain PAO1 as compared to the strain containing the qscR null mutation. RNA were extracted from cultures at OD 0.5, 0.8, 1.4, 2.0 and 3.5

Bacterial populations continue to thrive in highly polluted environments and bacteria must have mechanisms to counter heavy metal stress. We chose to examine the response of the environmentally-relevant organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa to two different copper treatments. A short, 45 min exposure to copper was done in the Cu shock treatment to examine the immediate transcriptional profile to Cu stress. The Cu adapted treatment was designed to view the transcriptional profile of cells that were actively growing in the presence of Cu. Experiment Overall Design: We analyzed 2 biological replicates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exposed to a 45 min Cu shock as compared to a control that was exposed to HCl to bring the pH to similar levels. We analyzed 2 biological replicates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were grown in the presence of Cu for approx. 6h (Cu adapted) as compared to an untreated control.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a problematic colonizer of the human lung. P. aeruginosa produces a phospholipase C (PlcH) that degrades choline-containing lipids such as phosphatidylcholine and sphingomylein that are found in lung surfactant and in host membranes. In this study, we analyzed gene expression in mutants defective in PlcH production (delta-plcH and delta-gbdR) and the wild type when growing in medium with lung surfactant. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured in liquid cultures with aeration in a defined medium with Survanta, a lung surfactant replacement. Cultures were harvested during mid-exponential phase, and RNA was isolated for microarray analysis. The P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 wild type gene expression was compared to expression profiles from delta-gbdR and delta-plcHR deletion mutants, two mutants defective in PlcH production.

We identified bacterial metabolite - phenylacetic acid (PAA) which acts as an inhibitory molecule counteracting its pathogenic infection. Microarray and genetic analyses were conducted to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of the identified inhibitor PAA on bacterial virulence. Microarray analysis revealed that treatment of P. aeruginosa with PAA down-regulated the transcriptional expression of type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) genes and related regulatory genes including rsmA and vfr, which were confirmed by transcriptional and translational analysis. Our findings present a new insight to the puzzle of high-cell-density-modulated virulence attenuation in P. aeruginosa and the regulatory mechanisms of T3SS which is associated with bacterial acute infection. Overnight PAO1 culture were diluted 1:200 to fresh LB medium supplemented with nitriloacetic acid (NTA) with or without addition of 1 mM of phenylacetic acid (PAA). The growth was continued with shaking at 37°C for 4 h to allow OD600 reaching about 1.5 and the cells were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Accordingly we show that the production of all P. aeruginosa virulence factors that are dependent on the QS transcriptional regulator RhlR, but only a fraction that are activated by LasR, are induced at 37 °C compared to 30 °C or 25 °C. The RhlR-dependent induction at 37 °C is a posttranscriptional effect due to an RNA thermometer of the ROSE family that thermoregulates the expression of rhlAB operon involved in rhamnolipids production, a virulence associated trait. This RNA structure also affects the expression of the downstream rhlR gene. A second thermometer is present upstream lasI and causes a reduced expression of this gene at lower temperatures without causing a significant decrease of the autoinducer 3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone. Using transcriptomic analysis and quantitative real time PCR we show that these RNA thermometers are the main mechanism of thermoregulation of P. aeruginosa virulence factor production.

DNA microarrays were employed to identify genes involved in D-Glu catabolism. Through gene knockout and growth phenotype analysis, the divergent dguR-dguABC (D-glutamate utilization) gene cluster was shown to participate in D-Glu catabolism and regulation. The dguA gene encodes a FAD-dependent D-amino acid dehydrogenase with D-Glu as its preferred substrate, and its promoter was specifically induced by exogenous D-Glu and D-Gln. The function of DguR as transcriptional activator of the dguABC operon was demonstrated by promoter activity measurements in vivo and by mobility shift assays with purified His-tagged DguR in vitro. Although the DNA-binding activity of DguR did not require D-Glu, the presence of D-Glu in the binding reaction was found to stabilize a preferred nucleoprotein complex. The dguB gene encodes a putative enamine/imine deaminase of the RidA family, but its role in D-Glu catabolism remained to be determined. While a lesion in dguC encoding a periplasmic solute binding protein did not affect growth on D-Glu, the AatJMQP transporter for acidic amino acid uptake was found essential for D-Glu and L-Glu utilization. Expression of this uptake system was subjected to induction by exogenous DL-Glu, most likely via the AauSR two-component system. In summary, DguA was identified in this study as a new member of the FAD-dependent amino acid dehydrogenase family for D-amino acid catabolism. DguR serves as a D-Glu sensor and transcriptional activator of the dguA promoter. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was chosen as model to study gene response with different D-amino acids.

ParA(Soj) and ParB(Spo0J) proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are both important for optimal growth, nucleoids segregation, cell division and different types of motility. Comparative transcriptome analysis of parAnull, parBnull mutants versus parental PAO1161 strain of P. aeruginosa demonstrated global changes in genes expression pattern in logarithmic phase of planktonic cultures grown on rich medium. The set of genes that were similarly regulated in both mutant strains as compared to the wild-type strain as well as two sets of genes uniquely affected in the particular mutant were defined suggesting that ParA and ParB may act in common and independently. In general, many genes involved in cell division, DNA and RNA processing and metabolic processes were down-regulated in mutant cells, in contrast genes which products play a role in adaptation, protection, motility, cell-to-cell signaling as well as signal transduction increased their expression in par mutant cells. Besides their role in chromosome segregation, ParA and ParB seem to have the potential to regulate genes transcription. The altered expression of a large number of genes encoding known or predicted transcriptional regulators and genes coding for products involved in c-di-GMP signalling, suggests that the part of observed global changes in genes expression pattern in parAnull and parBnull mutants might be the effect of indirect regulation mediated by regulatory genes under ParA and ParB control. The extended regulatory network provides the mechanism to modulate genes expression in response to the stage of the chromosome segregation process and cell cycle. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161 (leu, r-, RifR), derivative of PAO1, as a control (reference) strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161 parA1-40::smh (parAnull) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161 parB1-18::TcR (parBnull) disruption mutant strains were used in the experiments. Three independent biological replicates of total RNA were isolated for each strain from logarithmic (Log) phase of planktonic culture grown on rich medium (L broth) at 37oC. In total, nine samples of RNA were prepared.

Rep1	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can adapt to changing environments and can secrete an exopolysaccharide known as alginate as a protection response resulting in a colony morphology and phenotype referred to as mucoid. However how P. aeruginosa senses its environment and activates alginate overproduction is not fully understood. Previously, we showed that Pseudomonas isolation agar (PIA) supplemented with ammonium metavanadate (PIAAMV) induces P. aeruginosa to overproduce alginate. Vanadate is a phosphate mimic and causes protein misfolding by disruption of disulfide bonds. Here we used PIAAMV to characterize the pathways involved in inducible alginate production and tested the global effects of P. aeruginosa growth on PIAAMV by a mutant library screen, transcriptomics, and in a murine acute virulence model. The PA14 non-redundant mutant library was screened on PIAAMV to identify new genes that are required for the inducible alginate stress response. A functionally diverse set of genes encoding products involved in cell envelope biogenesis, peptidoglycan, uptake of phosphate and iron, phenazines biosynthesis, and other processes were identified as positive regulators of the mucoid phenotype on PIAAMV. Transcriptome analysis of P. aeruginosa growing in the presence of vanadate caused differential expression of genes involved in virulence, envelope biogenesis, and cell stress pathways. In this study, it was observed that growth on PIAAMV attenuates P. aeruginosa in a mouse pneumonia model. Induction of alginate overproduction occurs as a stress response to protect P. aeruginosa but it may be possible to modulate and inhibit these pathways based on the new genes identified in this study. Strain PAO1 was cultured on both PIA and PIAAMV for 18 hr. Three separate plates were used for each media. The cells from each plate were scraped into 4 ml of RNA Protect (Qiagen) and stored immediately at -80°C. Cells were treated with RNAprotect (Qiagen) and total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini purification kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality and the presence of residual DNA were checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 electrophoretic system pre- and post-DNase treatment. Ten micrograms of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, and labeling according to the Affymetrix GeneChip P. aeruginosa genome array expression analysis protocol. RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, labeling and microarray analysis were performed as previously described in reference: Damron, F. H., J. P. Owings, Y. Okkotsu, J. J. Varga, J. R. Schurr, J. B.

To model the environment of the distal airway, we used bovine pulmonary surfactant (Survanta). P. aeruginosa transcript levels were measured in the presence or absence of Survanta in MOPS minimal medium to identify transcripts altered in response to surfactant. The most highly induced transcript in Survanta was PA5325, renamed sphA based on our findings that the gene was specifically induced by sphingosine derived from the sphingomyelin present in pulmonary surfactant. A divergently transcribed transcription factor, PA5324, was demonstrated to be critical for the sphingosine dependent induction of sphA and was therefore renamed SphR. Microarrays of the sphR mutant cells were compared to wild type to determine the likely SphR regulon. Wild type and sphR mutant cells were pre-grown in MOPS minimal media and then split and resuspended in MOPS pyruvate or MOPS pyruvate + surfactant

We have been investigating P. aeruginosa’s response to the host, particularly changes regulated by the host-derived quaternary amines choline and glycine betaine (GB). We previously identified GbdR as an AraC-family transcription factor that directly regulates choline acquisition from host phospholipids (via binding to plcH and pchP promoters), is required for catabolism of the choline metabolite GB, and is an activator that induces transcription in response to GB or dimethylglycine. Our goal was to characterize the GbdR regulon in P. aeruginosa using genetics and chemical biology in combination with transcriptomics and in vitro DNA-binding assays. Here we show that GbdR activation regulates transcription of 26 genes from 12 promoters; 11 of which have measureable binding to GbdR in vitro. The GbdR regulon includes the genes encoding GB, dimethylglycine, sarcosine, glycine, and serine catabolic enzymes, and the BetX and CbcXWV quaternary amine transport proteins. . Additionally, identification of two uncharacterized regulon members suggests roles for these proteins in response to choline metabolites. The conditions for inclusion in the gbdR regulon were: (i) called present in the array, (ii) changed more than 2.5-fold in signal in a statistically significant manner, (iii) altered in all three 'inducing' conditions (ethylcholine, choline+propargylcholine, and choline in the dgcA mutant), but (iv) not induced in the wild-type choline or diethylcholine treatments. Wild type and dgcA mutant cells were pre-grown in MOPS minimal media and then split and resuspended in MOPS pyruvate, MOPS pyruvate + choline, MOPS pyruvate + ethylcholine, MOPS pyruvate + diethylcholine, or MOPS pyruvate & choline + propargylcholine.

SigX, one of the 19 extra-cytoplasmic function sigma factors of P. aeruginosa, was only known to be involved in transcription of the gene encoding the major outer membrane protein OprF in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Deletion of the ECF sigma factor sigX gene provide insights into the SigX role in several virulence and biofilm- related phenotypes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To better understand the cellular function of SigX, a deletion mutant of the sigX gene (PAOSX) was generated and its expression profile was compared with parental strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa H103. To this end, H103 and a sigX mutant were cultured in M9G, in which their growth are similar. Three independant biological replicate were taken for the RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix array in the middle of the exponential growth phase.

Rep1	LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) are the most common family of transcriptional regulators found in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They are known to regulate a wide variety of virulence determinants and have emerged recently as positive global regulators of pathogenicity in a broad spectrum of serious bacterial pathogens. However, in spite of their key role in modulating expression of key virulence determinants underpinning pathogenic traits associated with the process of infection, surprisingly few were found to be transcriptionally altered in co-culture with host cells. bvlR (PA14_26880) an LTTR of previously unknown function, has been shown to be induced in response to host cells, and was therefore investigated for its potential role in virulence. BvlR expression was found to play a pivotal role in regulation of acute virulence determinants such as type III secretion and exotoxin A production. In contrast, loss of bvlR led to an inability to form tight microcolonies, a key step in biofilm formation in the mucoid lung, although surface attachment was increased. bvlR was also seen to a key role in P.aeruginosa pathogenicity within the acute model of infection, Caenorhabditis elegans. Unusually for LTTRs, BvlR was shown to exert its influence exclusively through the transcriptional repression of 307 genes, including the divergently transcribed gene bvlA. This highlights the importance of BvlR as a previously uncharacterized global virulence regulator in P. aeruginosa with a key role in the transcriptional response underlying the host pathogen interaction. Six samples were analysed in total, three biological replicates of the bvlR mutant and bvlR complemented strains.

We performed high-time-resolution (HTR) transcriptome analyses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (PA) in a continuous cultivation system during the transition from high oxygen tension to low oxygen tension (HLOT) and the reversed transition from low to high oxygen tension (LHOT). From those genes responsive to both transient conditions, we identified 85 essential oxygen-availability responsive genes (EORGs), including the expected ones (arcDABC) encoding enzymes for arginine fermentation. We then predicted a highly accurate regulatory network for the EORGs of PA by integrating information from binding motif searching, literature and inverted HTR datasets. These results not only reveal stringent EORGs of PA and their transcription regulatory network, but also highlight that achieving a high accuracy of the inferred regulatory network might be only feasible for the apparently affected regulators under the given conditions but not for all the expressed regulators in a genome scale. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (PA) from a continuous cultivation system during two inverted oxygen-availability transitions were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix P. aeruginosa Genome Array . Our aim is to identify essential oxygen-availability responsive genes and to infer an accurate oxygen-responsive regulatory network. In total, 14 samples were harvested at time points 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 min after switching from aerobic to microaerobic condition. After reaching a steady state (after about another four bioreactor volume exchange) under these conditions, the culture was shifted from microaerobic back to fully aerobic condition (pO2 set point value from 0.5% to 100%). A similar set of samples were taken during the reversed transition with the same time intervals.

In sharp contrast, there are far fewer studies describing the transport and assimilation of C5-dicarboxylates among bacteria. In an effort to better our understanding on this subject, we identified the structural and regulatory genes necessary for the utilization of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The PA5530 gene, encoding a putative dicarboxylate transporter, was found to be essential for the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on both α-KG and glutarate (another C5-dicarboxylate). Metabolite analysis confirmed that the PA5530 gene was necessary for the uptake of extracellular α-KG. Like other substrate-inducible transporter genes, expression of the PA5530 gene was induced by extracellular C5-dicarboxylates. It was later found that the expression of the PA5530 gene was driven solely by a -24/-12 promoter recognized by the alternative sigma factor RpoN. Surprisingly, the enhancer binding protein MifR, which is known to have an essential role in biofilm development, was required for the expression of the PA5530 gene. The MifR protein is homologous to other transcriptional regulators involved in dicarboxylate assimilation, suggesting that MifR might interact with RpoN to activate the expression of the PA5530 gene in response to extracellular C5-dicarboxylates, especially α-KG. The results of this study provide a framework for exploring the assimilation of α-KG in other pseudomonads.

PA14 genes lasR and rhlR are necessary for quorum sensing via homoserine lactones. A PA14 lasR rhlR deficient mutant exhibits a reduced oxidative stress response. Here we conducted a microarray to determine oxidative stress response gene regulation mediated by the homoserine lactone quorum sensing circuits. A PA14 lasR rhlR deficient mutant was compared to the wild-type with and without H2O2 stress.

In this study, we use DNA microarrays to characterize the global transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa to clinical-like doses of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and also to determine the component that is regulated by LexA cleavage and the SOS response. We find that genes involved in virtually every facet of metabolism are down-regulated in response to ciprofloxacin. The LexA-controlled SOS regulon identified by microarray analysis includes only fifteen genes, but does include several genes that encode proteins involved in recombination and replication, including two inducible polymerases known to play a role in mutation and the evolution of antibiotic resistance in other organisms. The data suggests that the inhibition of LexA cleavage during therapy might help combat this pathogen by decreasing its ability to adapt and evolve resistance. Experiment Overall Design: Sample preparation and data analysis. For each strain (PAO1 and the lexA uninducible mutant), 5 clones were inoculated in LB and grown 18 h. Cultures were diluted 1:500 and grown to mid-log phase (OD600 ~0.4-0.5) at which point ciprofloxacin was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. At 0, 30 and 120 minutes following ciprofloxacin addition, appropriate volumes from each of the 5 cultures per strain were pooled and added to 2 volumes of RNAprotect reagent (Qiagen); cell pellets were stored at 4 ºC until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) at the end of the sample collection period. This procedure was repeated three independent times to generate three samples each just prior to and 120 minutes post ciprofloxacin addition.

This study examined the transcriptome response of a common soil bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to the common environmental contaminant pentachlorophenol (PCP). Cells were grown in chemostats at a low growth rate to obtain substrate-limited, steady-state, balanced-growth conditions. The PCP stress was administered as a continuous increase in concentration, and samples taken over time were examined for physiological function changes with whole cell acetate uptake rates (WAUR) and cell viability, and for gene expression changes using Affymetrix GeneChip technology and RT-PCR. Cell viability, measured by heterotrophic plate counts, showed a moderately steady decrease after exposure to the stressor, but WAURs did not change in response to PCP. In contrast to the physiological data, the microarray data showed significant changes in the expression of several genes. In particular, genes coding for multi-drug efflux pumps, including MexAB-OprM, were strongly upregulated. The upregulation of these efflux pumps protected the cells from the potentially toxic effects of PCP, allowing the physiological whole-cell function to remain constant.

Differential gene expression shows that 185 genes of the bacterium and 753 genes of the poplar tree were induced in the rhizosphere. Using the P. aeruginosa transcriptome analysis, isogenic knockout mutants, and two novel plant assays (poplar and barley), seven novel PAO1 virulence genes were identified (PA1385, PA2146, PA2462, PA2463, PA2663, PA4150 and PA4295). The uncharacterized putative haemolysin repressor, PA2463, upon inactivation, resulted in greater poplar virulence and elevated haemolysis while this mutant remained competitive in the rhizosphere. In addition, disruption of the haemolysin gene itself (PA2462) reduced the haemolytic activity of P. aeruginosa, caused less cytotoxicity and reduced barley virulence, as expected. Inactivating PA1385, a putative glycosyl transferase, reduced both poplar and barley virulence. Furthermore, disrupting PA2663, a putative membrane protein, reduced biofilm formation by 20-fold. Inactivation of PA3476 (rhlI) increased virulence with barley as well as haemolytic activity and cytotoxicity, so quorum sensing is important in plant pathogenesis. Hence, this strategy is capable of elucidating virulence genes for an important pathogen.

Rep1	Wound infections are traditionally thought to occur when microbial burden exceeds the innate clearance capacity of host immune system. Here we introduce the idea that the wound environment itself plays a significant contributory role to wound infection. We developed a clinically relevant murine model of soft tissue infection to explore the role of activation of microbial virulence in response to tissue factors as a mechanism by which pathogenic bacteria cause wound infections. Mice underwent abdominal skin incision and light muscle injury with a crushing forceps versus skin incision alone followed by topical inoculation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa whole genome transcriptional profiling demonstrated that fascia induced the activation of multiple genes responsible for the synthesis of the iron scavenging protein pyochelin. Ex-vivo murine fascia homogenates were prepared and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 was incubated with an inoculum of the fascia homogenate solution. Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 incubated under the same condtions without the homogenate was used as the control group. Three biological replicates in each group was used.

Rep1	Transcriptome analysis was applied to characterize the physiological activities of Psuedomonas aeruginosa cells grown for three days in drip flow biofilm reactors when compared to the activities of P. aeruginosa grown planktonically to exponential phase in the same media. Here, rather than examining the effect of an individual gene on biofilm antibiotic tolerance, we used a transcriptomics approach to identify regulons and groups of related genes that are induced during biofilm growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We then tested for statistically significant overlap between the biofilm-induced genes and independently compiled gene lists corresponding to stress responses and other putative antibiotic protective mechanisms. This data was evaluated and used to select strains that carry transposon mutations in genes that might play a role in antibiotic tolerance of biofilms.

Here, rather than examining the effect of an individual gene on biofilm antibiotic tolerance, we used a transcriptomics approach to identify regulons and groups of related genes that are induced during biofilm growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We then tested for statistically significant overlap between the biofilm-induced genes and independently compiled gene lists corresponding to stress responses and other putative antibiotic protective mechanisms. This data was evaluated and used to select strains that carry transposon mutations in genes that might play a role in antibiotic tolerance of biofilms. The strains were evaluated for defects in biofilm tolerance.

Flow cell biofilm. Rep1	In the present in vitro study, interactions between P. aeruginosa (sessile biofilms as well as planktonic cells) and PMNs were analyzed by means of DNA microarray based transcriptomics. We found that the P. aeruginosa wild type biofilms, in contrast to planktonic cultures and quorum sensing (QS) deficient strains, respond to PMN exposure in a rather aggressive manner. The response does not involve protective mechanisms such as those involved in oxidative stress. Rather it is dominated by QS controlled virulence determinants such as those encoded by pqs, phz, rhlAB, all of which are designed to cripple Eukaryotic cells including PMNs and macrophages. Our comparative analysis supports the view that QS plays a major role in mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa evades host defense systems. Keywords: Stress response The biofilms were allowed to grow and develop in the biofilm flow chambers for 3 days before challenge with PMNs. Fresh PMNs from human volunteers were isolated and resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium (BIOCHROM AG) as previously described by Bjarnsholt et al. 2005 (Bjarnsholt et al., 2005). Prior to PMN injection the flow was halted. Ten million PMNs were resuspended in 6 ml of RPMI media and injected into the flow chamber. The concentration of PMNs was found by microscopy to be approximately 1 PMN per 1000 bacterial cells. PMNs and biofilm were incubated for 2 hours. The flow chambers were rolled every 15 minutes to ensure that the entire biofilm was exposed to the PMNs. After incubation the fluid inside the chamber was discarded and the attached biofilm cells were loosened by rolling. The cells were then mechanically removed and collected in 6 ml of RNAlater®

However, the nutrient sources sustaining HCD replication in this chronic infection is largely unknown. Hence, understanding the nutrient factors contributing to HCD in the CF lung will yield new insights into the 'metabolic pathogenicity' and potential treatment of CF infections caused by P. aeruginosa. Herein, we performed microarray studies of P. aeruginosa directly isolated from the CF lung to demonstrate its metabolic capability and virulence in vivo. Our in vivo microarray data, confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription-PCR, indicated P. aeruginosa expressed several genes for virulence, drug-resistance, and utilization of multiple nutrient sources (lung surfactant lipids and amino acids) contributing to HCD replication. The data also indicates deregulation of several pathways, suggesting in vivo evolution by deregulation of a large portion of the transcriptome during chronic CF infection. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo transcriptome of P. aeruginosa in a natural CF infection, and it indicates several important aspects of pathogenesis, drug-resistance, and nutrient-utilization never before observed in vivo. Experiment Overall Design: The purpose of the experiment was to observe which genes are upregulated in P. aeruginosa during chronic CF lung infection as compared to PAO1. All in vitro studies were grown in 1x M9 minimal media supplemented with 20 mM citrate and grown to mid-log phase prior to RNA isolation. The in vivo RNA was isolated directly from CF sputum samples after TRIzol treatment. Each in vitro sample (both for PAO1 and the CF sputum pool isolate) were processed individually and in triplicate. Two in vivo isolations from sputum were conducted from the same patient but two different sputum samples. After isolation of total RNA, samples were processed for microarrays (i.e. cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, labeling, etc) as recommended by Affymetrix, and processed on the GeneChip as recommended by Affymetrix.

In addition, fatty acid biosynthesis (Fab) is essential for the syntheses of two virulence controlling acylated-homoserine-lactone molecules in this organism. We mapped the promoter regions of the fadBA5-operon (PA3014 and PA3013) and a fadE homologue (PA2815) involved in Fad and the fabAB-operon involved in Fab. Focusing on the transposon mutagenesis of strain PAO1 carrying the PfadBA5-lacZ fusion, we identified a regulator for the fadBA5-operon to be PsrA (PA3006). Transcriptome analysis of the DpsrA mutant indicates its importance in regulating b-oxidative enzymes, which confirms a previous proteomic study. We further showed that induction of the fadBA-operon responds to LCFA signals, and this induction requires the presence of PsrA, suggesting that PsrA binds to LCFA to derepress fadBA5. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay indicate specific binding of PsrA to the fadBA5-promoter region. This binding is disrupted by specific LCFA (C18:1D9, C16:0, and to a lesser extent C14:0), but not by the first intermediate of b-oxidation, acyl-CoA. We proposed that PsrA is a Fad-regulator that binds and responds to LCFA signals in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Cells were grown with 500 uM Sulfate in repeated batch cultures for at least 20 generations. These cells were then used to inoculate the starter culture needed for RNA preparation.

A large family of genes was found to be upregulated by sulfate limitation in both isolates, encoding sulfatases and sulfonatases, transport systems, oxidative stress proteins, and a sulfate-regulated TonB/ExbBD complex. These genes were localized in five distinct islands on the genome, and encoded proteins with a significantly reduced content of cysteine and methionine. Growth of P. aeruginosa E601 with mucin as sulfur source led to a sulfate starvation response, but also to induction of genes involved with type III secretion systems. Experiment Overall Design: Gene expression in exponential-phase cells was analysed using Affymetrix arrays. Sulfur was supplied either as sulfate, or as the non-sulfate S sources cyclamate (sodium cyclohexylsulfamate) and mucin (human colon cell line mucin LS174T). Control experiments were also done with combinations of these sulfur sources. Studies with mucin as sulfur source were carried out with P. aeruginosa E601 (a CF isolate with mucin sulfatase activity) and comparative studies were performed with P. aeruginosa PAO1. Experiments with strain E601 were done in 3-4 fold replication, experiments with strain PAO1 with 2-3 fold replication.

This regulatory system consists of an outer membrane-localized TonB-dependent receptor (TonB-dependent transducer), a cytoplasmic membrane-localized anti-sigma factor and an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor. By microarray analysis we have identified the regulons of four novel P. aeruginosa signaling systems. For that, the ECF sigmas PA0149, PA2050, PA2093 and PA4896 have been overexpressed in P. aeruginosa and their target gene candidates have been identified using DNA microarray. Experiment Overall Design: Five different samples are analyzed namely P. aeruginosa (pMMB67EH) (control/reference sample), P. aeruginosa (pMMB-PA4896) (overexpressing the PA4896 ECF sigma factor), P. aeruginosa (pMMB-PA0149) (overexpressing the PA0149 ECF sigma factor), P. aeruginosa (pMMB-PA2050) (overexpressing the PA2050 ECF sigma factor), and P. aeruginosa (pMMB-PA2093) (overexpressing the PA2093 ECF sigma factor). Two different replicates are included for the three first samples and one for the two last samples.

The cells require mechanisms to maintain homeostasis of intracellular polyamines to prevent otherwise severe adverse effects. We performed a detailed transcriptome profile analysis of P. aeruginosa in response to agmatine and putrescine with an emphasis in polyamine catabolism. Agmatine serves as precursor compound for putrescine (and hence spermidine and spermine), which was proposed to convert into GABA and succinate before entering the TCA cycle in support of cell growth as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Two acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases, AphA and AphB, were identified to be involved in the conversion of agmatine into putrescine. Enzymatic products of AphA were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, the alanine-pyruvate cycle was shown indispensable for polyamine utilization. The newly identified dadRAX locus, encoding the regulator, alanine transaminase and racemase respectively, coupled with SpuC, the major putrescine-pyruvate transaminase, were key components to maintain alanine homeostasis. Corresponding mutant strains were severely hampered in polyamine utilization. On the other hand, the alternative gamma-glutamylation pathway for the conversion of putrescine into GABA was also discussed. Subsequently, GabD, GabT and PA5313 were identified for GABA utilization. Growth defect of PA5313 gabT double mutant in GABA suggested the importance of these two transaminases. The succinic-semialdehyde dehydrogenase activity of GabD and its induction by GABA was also demonstrated in vitro. Polyamine utilization in general was proven independent of the PhoPQ two-component system even the expression of which was induced by polyamines. Multiple potent catabolic pathways as depicted in this study could serve pivotal roles in control of intracellular polyamine levels. Experiment Overall Design: P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown aerobically in minimal medium P with 350 rpm shaking at 37C, in the presence of L-glutamate alone or with the addition of putrescine, agmatine or GABA at 20 mM. Cells were harvested when the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5~0.6 by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 4C. Total RNA samples were isolated by RNeasy purification kit following instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen). Reverse transcription for cDNA synthesis, fragmentation by DNase I treatment, cDNA probe labeling and hybridization were performed according to the instructions of GeneChip manufacturer (Affymetrix). Data were processed by Microarray Suite 5.0 software normalizing the absolute expression signal values of all chips to a target intensity of 500. GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics) was used for expression pattern analysis and comparison. Only genes showing consistent expression profiles in duplicates were selected for further analysis.

Biofilms on plant roots. 330 mM phosphate. Rep1	Plants and rhizosphere microbes rely closely on each other, with plants supplying carbon to bacteria in root exudates, and bacteria mobilizing soil-bound phosphate for plant nutrition. When the phosphate supply becomes limiting for plant growth, the composition of root exudation changes, affecting rhizosphere microbial communities and microbially-mediated nutrient fluxes. To evaluate how plant phosphate deprivation affects rhizosphere bacteria, Lolium perenne seedlings were root-inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7NR, and grown in axenic microcosms under different phosphate regimes (330 uM vs 3-6 uM phosphate). The effect of biological nutrient limitation was examined by DNA microarray studies of rhizobacterial gene expression.

In contrast, a 4:1 (wt/wt) combination of fosfomycin and tobramycin (F:T), which is under investigation for use in the treatment of CF lung infection, has increased activity against P. aeruginosa under anaerobic conditions. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased activity of F:T under anaerobic conditions. Microarray analysis was used to identify the transcriptional basis of increased F:T activity under anaerobic conditions, and key findings were confirmed by microbiological tests, including nitrate utilization assays, growth curves, and susceptibility testing. Notably, growth in subinhibitory concentrations of F:T, but not tobramycin or fosfomycin alone, significantly downregulated (P < 0.05) nitrate reductase genes narG and narH, which are essential for normal anaerobic growth of P. aeruginosa. Under anaerobic conditions, F:T significantly decreased (P < 0.001) nitrate utilization in P. aeruginosa strains PAO1, PA14, and PA14 lasR::Gm, a mutant known to exhibit increased nitrate utilization. A similar effect was observed with two clinical P. aeruginosa isolates. Growth curves indicate that nitrate reductase transposon mutants had reduced growth under anaerobic conditions, with these mutants also having increased susceptibility to F:T compared to the wild type under similar conditions. The results of this study suggest that downregulation of nitrate reductase genes resulting in reduced nitrate utilization is the mechanism underlying the increased activity of F:T under anaerobic conditions.

A mutant of PT5 able to grow at 4 mg/l BAL30072, a drug-siderophore conjugate, was selected in vitro . The susceptible wild type strain PT5 and the mutant (BAL6) were grown in LB medium and the mutant also in the presence of 4 mg/l BAL30072 to mid-exponential growth phase (OD600 =2) in triplicate cultures. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). A total of nine Affymterix P. aeruginosa arrays were hybridized (one for each replicate) under standard conditions.

However, the regulatory effects that occur directly upstream of the rhl QS system are poorly understood. Here, we show that deletion of gene encoding for the two-component sensor BfmS leads to the activation of its cognate response regulator BfmR, which in turn directly binds to the promoter and decreases the expression of the rhlR gene that encodes the QS regulator RhlR, causing the inhibition of the rhl QS system. In the absence of bfmS, the Acka-Pta pathway can modulate the regulatory activity of BfmR. In addition, BfmS tunes the expression of 202 genes that comprise 3.6% of the P. aeruginosa genome. We further demonstrate that deletion of bfmS causes substantially reduced virulence in lettuce leaf, reduced cytotoxicity, enhanced invasion, and reduced bacterial survival during acute mouse lung infection. Intriguingly, specific missense mutations, which occur naturally in the bfmS gene in P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis (CF) isolates such as DK2 strains and RP73 strain, can produce BfmS variants (BfmSL181P, BfmSL181P/E376Q, and BfmSR393H) that no longer repress, but instead activate BfmR. As a result, BfmS variants, but not the wild-type BfmS, inhibit the rhl QS system. This study thus uncovers a previously unexplored signal transduction pathway, BfmS/BfmR/RhlR, for the regulation of rhl QS in P. aeruginosa. We propose that BfmRS TCS may have an important role in the regulation and evolution of P. aeruginosa virulence during chronic infection in CF lungs.
