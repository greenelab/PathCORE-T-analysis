# Description
Data files that are too large to store in this Github repository have been
deposited into zenodo for versioning. These are downloaded by running
`./download_data.sh`. In addition to the zenodo records, additional
information about how the data files were obtained (links to other
repositories or scripts, citations) are provided as comments in the
shell script.

## Pathway definitions files
### KEGG PAO1 pathways
The KEGG pathway definitions file `./pao1_data/pseudomonas_KEGG_terms.txt` 
was created using the script `./get_annotations.py`. This script accesses
[Tribe](https://tribe.greenelab.com/) programmatically through its API to
retrieve the genes annotated to each KEGG PAO1 pathway (see line 50 in
`./download_data.sh`).

### Nature-NCI PID pathways
The PID pathway definitions file `./tcga_data/PID_pathway_definitions.txt`
is generated by parsing the file `./tcga_data/c2.cp.v6.0.symbols.gmt`, which
is provided by [MSigDB v6.0](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp)
under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). We have provided a copy
of it here for versioning. The script `./get_pid_pathway_definitions.py`
parses the `.gmt` file and produces the PID pathway definitions file (see line
89 in `./download_data.sh`).

## _P. aeruginosa_ KEGG network demo server information
The files in `./pao1_web_info` were obtained from the following sources

### Sample annotations file
The sample annotations file `PseudomonasAnnotation.tsv` was retrieved by running

```sh
curl -o PseudomonasAnnotation.tsv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenelab/adage-server/00b2d19668516910c7b968f4164005cf5a59ddd6/data/PseudomonasAnnotation.tsv
```

and is from the
[Greene Lab `adage-server`](https://github.com/greenelab/adage-server)
repository (`data` directory).

bioRxiv 2016, :078659.

### Gene identifier information
The gene information file `Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_PAO1.gene_info` was retrieved
by running

```sh
curl -O ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Archaea_Bacteria/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_PAO1.gene_info.gz
gunzip Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_PAO1.gene_info.gz
```
